## Tagging your source code

Your source code should have comments containing equation numbers in this format (spaces are optional):

```$(VERSION - EQUATION_NUMBER)```

for instance:

```$(0.4.5 - 123)```

If a block of code implements multiple equations, use \ separators:

```$(VERSION - EQ1 \ EQ2 \ E3)```

```bash
python jambiato.py YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY
